# Implement: Outside-in TDD

**Entry:** Agent enters `implement` phase. The ticket's `impl-plan.md` (written at scenario-gate exit, status `planned`) is the design record for this phase — follow its Approach section's proof plan and build order. Begin TDD for the first unchecked scenario.

## Harness availability check (entry)

Before the first RED, confirm the project's test harness actually runs — judge from existing signals (a `test` script in the project manifest, the scaffolded acceptance lane under `features/`, the project's conventional test directory). `safeword setup` scaffolds a runnable lane into every project, so absence is the exception (pre-existing installs, projects using their own runner like pytest-bdd, brownfield repos).

**Harness present** → standard loop below, no ceremony.

**Harness absent** → behavioral tests are not yet executable for this project. Do not fake test runs and do not stall: implement using the service's **existing test patterns** (unit tests, integration tests, whatever the project already runs — for untested legacy code, characterization tests that pin current behavior are the canonical first move), keeping the same RED/GREEN/REFACTOR discipline and checkbox tracking. Then:

- Annotate the ticket work log: `- Harness absent; using existing service test patterns. Follow-up: wire behavioral harness.` (narrative entry — no timestamp; the clock belongs to the phase hook)
- Recommend a follow-up ticket (`Wire behavioral test harness for {project}`) — prompt the user; don't auto-create it.

Degradation is the intended path — no gate blocks on harness absence.

## Core rules

1. Write the failing test first and confirm it fails for the intended reason — behavior missing, not a syntax error — before writing any implementation.
2. Write only the code the test requires: GREEN is minimal, REFACTOR adds quality.

## Test Scope

Start with the most constraining test — usually E2E or integration. Prefer the highest scope that covers the behavior with acceptable feedback speed.

### Feature-source executable path

When the scenario source is a `.feature` file and the Cucumber lane exists, RED starts by making that scenario executable through Cucumber step definitions:

- If `.safeword/config.json` sets `bdd.conventions`, read that doc first and follow it over the defaults below — it defines the host harness's stub shape, its spec-ahead verification lane (often a dry-run/check profile, not run-and-expect-failure), and its tag rules. Never pass ad-hoc `--tags` filters that bypass the host profiles' exclusions.
- If no matching steps exist, the first RED can be `bun run test:bdd` failing with undefined or pending steps, then add the thinnest TypeScript step definitions under the project's step directory (`steps/` or `features/steps/` by default; `paths.steps` when configured). Run-and-expect-failure proves wiring for safeword's scaffolded lane — an adopted host harness whose hooks boot real infrastructure needs its documented dry-run/check profile instead.
- **Verify RED on the reported step status, not the exit code alone.** Safeword's scaffolded `test:bdd` runs cucumber-js _without_ `--dry-run`, so undefined/pending steps exit non-zero — a genuine RED. But `cucumber-js --dry-run` _reports_ undefined/ambiguous/pending steps while still **exiting 0**; a lane (or host profile) built on `--dry-run` will look green even when steps are missing. Never substitute a bare `--dry-run` for this RED check, and when a dry-run/check profile is the host's spec-ahead lane, confirm RED by the reported undefined/pending count it prints, not by its exit status.
- Keep step definitions thin; call app, API, CLI, or shell helpers from steps. Do not bury business logic in Cucumber glue.
- Use Vitest for lower-level implementation proof when it gives faster or more precise coverage, especially pure functions and module contracts.
- A scenario is not complete until both the relevant implementation tests and `test:bdd` pass, unless the feature is explicitly tagged `@manual` or `@live` with a skip reason.

### Walking Skeleton (first scenario only)

If no E2E infrastructure exists, build skeleton first: thinnest slice proving architecture works (form → API → response → UI, no real logic).

## For Each Scenario: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

Pick first unchecked scenario from test-definitions. Cycle through RED (failing test, commit) → GREEN (minimal code to pass, commit) → REFACTOR (if needed, commit).

### Checkbox Format Contract

Mark **ONE checkbox per edit, commit after each step.** The prompt hook and quality gates parse these checkboxes; batching hides which step should be internally reviewed and makes the ledger less auditable.

**Correct format** (matches template exactly):

```markdown
## Scenario: User logs in

Given a registered user
When they submit valid credentials
Then they see the dashboard

- [x] RED abc1234
- [x] GREEN def5678
- [x] REFACTOR skip: no structural improvement needed
```

**Annotation rule (enforced by hook):** every `[x]` transition must carry either a commit SHA (proving which commit did that step) or `skip: <non-empty reason>` (a deliberate, auditable omission). Bare `[x]` without an annotation is blocked at the write-time hook. Pre-existing bare `[x]` from before this rule shipped is silently allowed — the validation is forward-looking only.

At the bottom of `test-definitions.md`, add one row for the whole-ticket cross-scenario refactor pass (same annotation rule applies). It's **completed at implement-exit** (see "whole-ticket quality review + refactor" below), and the done-gate requires it only when the ticket has **two or more RGR loops** — a single-loop ticket has nothing to cross and may leave it unmarked:

```markdown
## Feature-level cross-scenario refactor

- [x] cross-scenario <sha> # or `skip: <reason>`
```

**Invalid — do NOT:**

- `- [x] Red` / `- [x] green` — use ALL CAPS: `RED`, `GREEN`, `REFACTOR`
- Mark `RED` and `GREEN` in the same edit — one checkbox per edit, commit between
- `- [x] RED` with no SHA and no `skip:` — blocked at write-time
- `- [x] REFACTOR skip:` with empty or whitespace-only reason — blocked at write-time
- Reuse the same SHA across two steps in one scenario — caught at the done-gate (each step needs its own distinct commit)
- Modify test files in a REFACTOR commit — blocked at commit-time (test changes during cleanup are behavior changes in disguise)
- Add extra checkboxes like `- [ ] REVIEW` — only RED/GREEN/REFACTOR

**Evidence before claims:** Show test output, don't just claim "tests pass". Run the targeted suite at GREEN for fast feedback; run the FULL suite once at scenario close (after REFACTOR) to catch cross-module regressions.

### Red flags — stop and rethink:

| Flag                    | Action                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Test passes immediately | Rewrite — you're testing nothing              |
| Syntax error            | Fix syntax, not behavior                      |
| Wrote implementation    | Delete it, return to test                     |
| Multiple tests at once  | Pick ONE                                      |
| Tautological test       | Assert on behavior, not implementation mirror |

### Refactor Decision

Assess: duplication, unclear naming, excessive length? If yes, refactor (small changes directly, structural changes via `/refactor`). If no, proceed to next scenario.

## Implement exit: whole-ticket quality review + refactor

All scenarios green → before reconciling the plan, do one pass over the **whole ticket** (not a single loop). Skip it only when the ticket has a single RGR loop — there's nothing to cross.

1. **Quality-review the whole diff.** Run `/quality-review` across everything the ticket changed — the review's findings are the refactor ledger. The done-gate requires a logged `/quality-review` invocation for ≥2-loop tickets (see the skill's invocation-log block).
2. **Refactor the findings.** Work the cross-scenario cleanups `/quality-review` surfaced — shared fixtures, duplicated logic, naming drift that only shows up across loops. One change → test → commit, per the `/refactor` skill. Only real wins; don't gold-plate.
3. **Record the row.** Mark the `## Feature-level cross-scenario refactor` row with the refactor commit `<sha>`, or `skip: <reason>` when no cross-loop cleanup was warranted. The done-gate hard-blocks a ≥2-loop ticket whose row is missing or carries an empty `skip:`.

Quiet implement mode means the RED/GREEN/REFACTOR reviews stayed internal. At implement exit, summarize scenarios completed, review/refactor work performed, `/quality-review` findings handled, test evidence, commits recorded, and any deferred risks.

Then reconcile the plan.

## Implement exit: reconcile the plan

All scenarios complete → reconcile `impl-plan.md` against what actually shipped, **before** advancing to verify (the stop hook blocks `verify`/`done` while the plan still says `planned`):

1. **Walk the Decisions table** — for each row ask "did we actually do this, or did we change our mind?" Update changed rows: new choice, new rationale, the abandoned choice moves into Alternatives considered.
2. **Walk Arch alignment** — for each claim ask "did the implementation honor this?" Move anything that deviated into **Known deviations** with the reason.
3. **Refresh Assessment triggers** — add triggers the implementation surfaced (e.g., "works at current scale, degrades past 10x").
4. **Flip the status line** to `**Status:** implemented`. The phase hook stamps the transition with real time (Claude Code — on other harnesses add a short transition entry yourself); log the reconciliation outcome ({N} decisions updated, {M} deviations recorded) as a narrative work-log entry.

_Worked example:_ the plan said "Decisions: parse with the shared markdown utility"; during implementation a local scan proved smaller, so the choice changed mid-implementation — the row now reads choice "local content-or-skip scan", with the shared utility recorded under Alternatives considered and the reason it lost. That update (not a rewrite of history — the alternatives column preserves it) is what reconciliation produces.

Reconciled → set `phase: verify` and continue directly into the verify phase:
run `/verify`, then `/audit`. Do not ask the user whether to proceed; verification
is agent-owned work. Ask the user only if `/verify`, `/audit`, or a review
surfaces a real spec, scope, value, or risk decision.

## Implement exit: independent design review (architecture review gate)

Off by default. When `.safeword/config.json` sets `architectureReviewGate: true`, the stop hook blocks `verify`/`done` for a new-flow feature until its `impl-plan.md` design has been **independently reviewed** — the same propose-then-challenge discipline the scenario-gate applies to scenarios, now applied to the design. Two requirements:

1. **Cited evidence.** The Decisions section must carry a citation — a URL or a `[n]` source-reference marker — proving the choice was weighed against real evidence (the `/figure-it-out` trace), or an auditable `skip: <reason>`.
2. **A fresh-context review.** Spawn a reviewer with **no conversation history**, handed only `impl-plan.md` and the ticket scope, to try to refute the design against its cited sources. On a pass, stamp it:

   ```bash
   bun .safeword/hooks/write-review-stamp.ts impl-plan
   ```

   The stamp binds to the plan's current content, so editing the design after review invalidates it — re-review and re-stamp.

**Cross-model (`crossModelReview: true`).** The reviewer must run on a **different model than the author** — a same-model reviewer shares the author's blind spots (correlated errors). Prefer one of comparable-or-better capability; never weaker. This means an explicit different-model subagent — **not** a `context: fork`, which inherits the author's model. Record the model you assigned:

```bash
bun .safeword/hooks/write-review-stamp.ts --model "<reviewer-model-id>" impl-plan
```

The gate compares that tag against the author model (captured at SessionStart) and enforces **different only** — "comparable-or-better" is your judgment, not gate-checked. An absent tag fails closed. If you can't run a different model, log a deliberate skip (`--skip "<reason>"`) rather than stamping a same-model review. (This gate is stricter than quality-review's advisory loop, which accepts a fresh-context pass on your own model — here a genuinely different model, or an explicit `--skip`, is required.)

**Avoid bloat.**
