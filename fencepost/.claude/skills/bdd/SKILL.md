# BDD Orchestrator

Behavior-first development for features. Discovery → Scenarios → Implementation.

Define the behavior before implementing it. When unsure whether work is a feature, default to a task (TDD directly) — the user can `/bdd` to override.

## Phase Tracking

Features progress through phases. Track in ticket frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: feature
phase: implement # intake | define-behavior | scenario-gate | implement | verify | done
---
```

**Phase meanings:**

| Phase             | What happens                    | Details      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `intake`          | Context check, discovery        | DISCOVERY.md |
| `define-behavior` | Writing Given/When/Then         | SCENARIOS.md |
| `scenario-gate`   | Validating scenarios            | SCENARIOS.md |
| `implement`       | Outside-in TDD                  | TDD.md       |
| `verify`          | Evidence gate: /verify + /audit | VERIFY.md    |
| `done`            | Close ticket                    | DONE.md      |

**Update phase when:**

- Completing a BDD phase → set next phase
- Scenario-gate complete → set `implement` (proof plan + sequencing happens at the scenario-gate exit)
- Handing off to TDD → set `implement`
- All scenarios pass → set `verify`
- /verify + /audit complete (verify.md exists) → set `done`

### Phase-exit review (Tier 2)

The **scenario-gate exit requires** an independent review of the scenarios — not
your own pass. (Your own inline pass is Tier 1: `/self-review`, per asset, as you
author.) Run it as a _fresh reviewer with no conversation history_ so the author
can't grade their own work: a forked subagent — a skill with `context: fork`, or
an explicit subagent — handed only the phase's artifacts and the ticket's scope,
applying the `/review-spec` procedure; **its** verdict decides. When
`crossModelReview` is on, that reviewer must be a **different model than the
author** — a same-model reviewer shares the author's blind spots. Prefer one of
comparable-or-better capability; never weaker. If you can't run a different
model, log a deliberate skip (`--skip "<reason>"`) rather than stamping a
same-model review. On a pass, record the stamp:

```bash
bun .safeword/hooks/write-review-stamp.ts --phase <phase you are leaving>
```

If the reviewer finds blocking issues, fix them and re-review — don't stamp.

Other phase exits don't need an independent review by default — they carry their
own guards (intake's user sub-phase gates, implement's tests, the done-gate's
evidence checks). When the **review gate** is enabled (`reviewGate` in
`.safeword/config.json` — e.g. autonomous runs where user gates auto-confirm,
ticket 2VCSZY), every phase advance requires a stamp, or a logged skip reason
(`… --phase <phase> --skip "<why no independent review is needed>"`).

## Resume Logic

**Resuming** means reconstruct where the ticket left off and continue. The ticket's `phase:` and the first unchecked ledger item tell you _where_; the last work-log entry tells you _what_. Announce where you're resuming, then continue.

**Resume by phase:**

| Phase             | Resume action                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `intake`          | Start understanding (propose-and-converge) |
| `define-behavior` | Continue drafting scenarios                |
| `scenario-gate`   | Continue validating scenarios              |
| `implement`       | Find first unchecked scenario, run TDD     |
| `verify`          | Run /verify and /audit, write verify.md    |
| `done`            | Close ticket (verify.md must exist)        |

## Current Behavior

Understand first and size internally (see SAFEWORD.md "Understanding" and "Sizing") — state the scope read inside your proposal, not as a separate announcement. If the user references an iteration/story/phase from a spec, resume its child ticket at the current phase, or create one and run full BDD if none exists; if a ticket already exists, read its phase and resume there.

**Artifact-first:** before doing a phase's work, create or verify its artifact — intake → `<namespace-root>/tickets/{ID}-{slug}/ticket.md`; define-behavior → the feature source at `features/<slug>.feature` (or the configured `paths.features` directory) plus the R/G/R ledger at `<namespace-root>/tickets/{ID}-{slug}/test-definitions.md`. Then execute the phase using its phase file, and update `phase:` on transition.

## Phase Files

Load the appropriate file based on current phase:

| Phase             | File         |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| `intake`          | DISCOVERY.md |
| `define-behavior` | SCENARIOS.md |
| `scenario-gate`   | SCENARIOS.md |
| `implement`       | TDD.md       |
| `verify`          | VERIFY.md    |
| `done`            | DONE.md      |
