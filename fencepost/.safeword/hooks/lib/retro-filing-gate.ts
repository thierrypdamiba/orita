// Retro filing STOP GATE (issue #628, ticket GH628F) — the reliable half of PATH B.
//
// The muted boundary nudge (lib/retro-nudge.ts) is a statement in a context
// channel where imperatives trip Claude's prompt-injection defenses; #628 showed
// agents read it once and elect not to act, stranding spooled drafts in an
// ephemeral container. Each harness ALSO has a sanctioned continuation channel at
// Stop that is documented to carry instructions (Claude/Codex `decision:"block"`
// reason, Cursor `followup_message`). This module owns the shared decision for
// that channel: WHEN to fire and WHAT one action to request.
//
// The instruction is a single dispatch — invoke the shipped `safeword-retro-filer`
// subagent with the spool path — not a filing procedure. The subagent does the
// reads/searches/creates in its OWN context (the parent sees one line), which is
// what keeps the user's conversation clean; the procedure lives in the shipped
// agent definition, not here.
//
// Delivery is at-least-once with an explicit ack: the filer DRAINS the spool
// (lib/retro-draft-spool.ts markDraftsFiled), so an unchanged batch re-fires on
// the next Stop until drained — capped at FILING_ATTEMPT_CAP attempts per batch
// (a persisted, batch-keyed counter), after which only the muted nudge remains.
// A batch that GAINS a draft is a new batch and the counter resets. Self-contained
// (node:* only) so the CLI and all three customer-repo hook adapters can run it.
