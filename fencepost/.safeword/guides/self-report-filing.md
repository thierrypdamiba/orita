# Self-Report Filing

**Triggered playbook.** Follow this whenever the Stop surfacing reports captured
signals **and** `selfReport.file` is on (it is **on by default**). Filing is
**autonomous — do not ask the user for approval.** The records are sanitized at
capture (allowlist-only; no customer data), so there is nothing for a human to
review; waiting for confirmation just drops the signal.

Safeword records its **own** runtime failures (non-zero CLI exits, uncaught hook
exceptions, gate escalations) to a sanitized, zero-egress spool. This playbook
turns those into GitHub issues. You only do **transport** — the drafts are
already sanitized.

## Where to file

Issues go on the **upstream `ArcadeAI/safeword` repo** — these are safeword's own
bugs, not the host project's. **Never** file them on the host project's tracker.
If your GitHub access can't write to `ArcadeAI/safeword`, say so briefly and skip —
do not improvise another target.

## Procedure

1. **Get the drafts.** Run:

   ```bash
   safeword self-report --format issue
   ```

   This prints a JSON array; each element is `{ signature, title, body, labels }`,
   one per distinct failure signature, already sanitized.

2. **Dedup, then file — one issue per signature.** For each draft:
   - Search `ArcadeAI/safeword` issues for the draft's exact `title`
     (GitHub MCP `search_issues` with `repo:ArcadeAI/safeword "<title>"`, or
     `gh issue list --search "<title>"`). Transport is your choice — MCP or `gh`.
   - **If an open issue with that title exists** → add a brief comment noting it
     recurred (include the occurrence count from the draft body). Do **not** open a
     duplicate.
   - **If none exists** → open a new issue with the draft's `title`, `body`, and
     `labels` verbatim. Don't edit the body to add detail you didn't capture.

3. **Respect the cap.** File at most **one issue per signature per session**, and
   no more than **5 new issues in a single session** — if there are more distinct
   signatures, file the top 5 by occurrence count and note that the rest were left
   for a later session. This keeps a crash-loop from flooding the tracker.

## Rules

The three bold invariants are shared word-for-word with `retro.md`; a parity
contract (`packages/cli/src/schema.ts` → `contracts`) keeps the two guides
from forking again (#801). Guide-specific rules follow them.

- **Autonomous** — no human approval; sanitization + dedup + caps are the safeguards, not a human gate.
- **Upstream only** — `ArcadeAI/safeword`, never the host project's tracker.
- **Code owns egress** — nothing leaves beyond what the sanitized output contains.

Specific to this playbook:

- Post the drafts **verbatim** — hand-adding context (paths, code, command
  output) defeats the sanitizer and can leak customer data. If GitHub access to
  the upstream repo is missing, say so briefly and skip — do not improvise
  another target.
- If unsure whether a signal is worth a new issue, prefer **commenting on an
  existing one**.

## Retro drafts (transcript-mined, cloud filing)

The invisible retro mines the session transcript for qualitative friction and, in
a cloud container where its REST transport can't authenticate, **spools** the
sanitized drafts to disk instead of losing them
(`.safeword/retro-drafts/<session>.jsonl`). Two surfaces then point at that spool:

- A **stop-gate dispatch** (the primary path): at a turn end with unfiled drafts,
  a continuation asks for exactly one action — invoke the **`safeword-retro-filer`
  subagent** with the spool path.
- A **boundary reminder** (the backstop): a factual one-liner stating how many
  unfiled drafts exist and where.

**Prefer the subagent.** When the `safeword-retro-filer` agent is available,
dispatch it (foreground) with the spool path and do nothing else: it owns the
dedup/verbatim/cap procedure, **drains the spool afterward** (that is the ack that
stops re-dispatch), and keeps all filing work out of the conversation. Do not
narrate or summarize the filing in that or later responses — the subagent's
one-line summary is the entire visible trace.

**Inline fallback** (no filer agent installed): file them the same way as the
self-report drafts above — same repo, same dedup, same cap, same verbatim rule —
with two differences:

1. **Get the drafts from the spool file** named in the reminder. It is JSONL: one
   `{ signature, title, body, labels, bodyDigest }` per line, already
   egress-sanitized (no customer data — do not add any). Dedup by the draft's
   content signature (the `<!-- safeword-retro-signature: … -->` marker in the
   body, or the `title`).
2. **Write the ack record, then drain.** After each successful post, append one
   `{"signature": ..., "issue": ...}` ack line to the spool's sibling ack file
   (`.acks.jsonl` in place of `.jsonl`), then rewrite the spool with only the
   drafts you did not file (delete it when none remain). The acks are what
   prove the drain honest — a drain without them trips safeword's bare-drain
   telemetry. Post the bodies exactly as spooled — the signature marker in
   each body is what dedup depends on, and each body is sealed by its
   `bodyDigest` (code-owned filing paths refuse a modified body —
   `hooks/lib/retro-draft-spool.ts` `verifyDraftBody`).

## Config

`.safeword/config.json` → `selfReport` (all default **on**):

```json
{ "selfReport": { "capture": true, "surface": true, "file": true } }
```

- `capture` (default `true`) — record signals to the local spool.
- `surface` (default `true`) — mention captured signals at the end of a turn.
- `file` (default `true`) — file them autonomously per this playbook. Set `false`
  to keep an install watch-only (capture + surface, no GitHub issues).
