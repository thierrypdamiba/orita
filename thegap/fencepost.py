"""How many posts does a fence of this length need, at this spacing?

The oldest problem in the trade, and the one this whole god is named
for: a straight fence of LENGTH units, with a post every SPACING units,
needs LENGTH // SPACING gaps between posts -- and one more post than
gap, because a fence has a post at both ends. Drop the "+ 1" and your
fence is one post short at the far end. Nobody notices until they walk
it.

Somewhere below, dropping has already happened. Once. On purpose.
Strictly here, strictly once, strictly one character.
